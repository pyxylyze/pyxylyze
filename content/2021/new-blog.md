## This Website

I initially created this blog in [react-static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static), moved it to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and finally settled on [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). The blog theme and prism highlighting theme are totally custom - colours are from [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/).

## Content To Expect

At work I mostly write code with JavaScript/TypeScript and backend work with Node.js. In my spare time I write Rust or Lisp code - So the content you will find here will most likely be a mix of code tutorials for these or other languages, tooling setup and config for mac or linux, dev-ops processes, general software engineering knowledge and indie dev experiences. 

Along with programming, I have experience as a visual designer with user interfaces and brand/logo design so I may write about my experiences in design and the front end space working closely with designers.
